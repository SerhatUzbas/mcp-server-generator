# MCP Server Creator

An AI-assisted tool for creating custom [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers and registering them with Claude Desktop.

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open protocol that enables AI models to securely interact with local and remote resources through standardized server implementations. MCP servers extend AI capabilities through file access, database connections, API integrations, and other contextual services.

## Features

This MCP server creator:

- Helps you create MCP servers with AI assistance
- Saves servers in a dedicated directory
- Automatically registers servers with Claude Desktop
- Provides a template to guide the AI in creating servers
- Allows you to manage and list your created servers

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

## Usage

Run the MCP server creator:

```
npm start
```

Then connect to it using Claude Desktop. You'll have access to the following tools:

### Getting the Template

The `getTemplate` tool will show you an example MCP server structure that you can use as a reference.

### Creating a Custom Server

To create a custom server, just describe what you want the server to do to Claude. Claude will:

1. Draft a complete server implementation
2. Save it to the `servers` directory
3. Register it with Claude Desktop (if requested)

```
Tool: createServer
Parameters:
- serverName: Name of your server
- serverCode: The complete server code (generated by the AI)
- registerWithClaude: Whether to register with Claude Desktop (default: true)
```

### Listing Available Servers

```
Tool: listServers
```

Lists all servers that have been created with this tool.

### Managing Claude Desktop Configuration

You can view and update the Claude Desktop configuration:

```
Tool: getClaudeConfig
Tool: updateClaudeConfig
```

## Example Workflow

1. Start a conversation with Claude, with the MCP Server Creator connected
2. Ask Claude to create a specific type of MCP server (e.g., "Create a weather API server")
3. Claude will create the server code based on your requirements
4. Claude will save the server and register it with Claude Desktop
5. You can now use your new server directly in Claude Desktop
